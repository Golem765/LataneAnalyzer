#About
This is the analyzer module of course work that is devoted to testing Latane's social impact theory. It's intention is to provide both frontend and analyzing possibilities, while the data is gathered using another module built with node.js and puppeteer.

This application also supports analyzing of fake (normal distributed) data solely for experimentation's sake.
